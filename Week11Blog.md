For April Fool's Day 2017 Reddit hosted a collaborative project and social experiment. This art piece by various members of Reddit was a great show of connected messaging to create an elaborate work. There are so many pieces of different art and it is incredible to see what each individual community was able to create. The simple idea was able to attract so many people and visually display each subreddit as the piece developed throughout that day. The interactivity about this project's concept is one of the most unique I have seen and I especially enjoyed watching the timelapse of the canvas.

IKEA Place is an augmented-reality (AR) app for your phone. While not quite an artistic piece, it is one of the best uses of physical computing for a real world application. By allowing the user to scroll through inventory and actually place the furniture into your home through the lens of your phone camera, IKEA Place allows much greater interaction and experience with almost no effort. It is an incredible usage of modern day technology which is able to make our lives so much simpler.
